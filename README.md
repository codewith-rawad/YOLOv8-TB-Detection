## üìã Project Overview

This repository contains an implementation of **Tuberculosis (TB) detection** from chest X-ray images using the **YOLOv8** object detection model. The goal is to automatically identify and localize tuberculosis-infected regions in X-rays to assist radiologists and healthcare professionals.

---

## ü©ª Dataset

- The dataset consists of chest X-ray images labeled for **Tuberculosis detection**.
- It includes **bounding box annotations** marking TB-infected regions.
- The dataset is split into:
  - **Train Images**: 1877
  - **Train Labels**: 1877
  - **Validation Images**: 260
  - **Validation Labels**: 260
  - **Test Images**: 150
  - **Test Labels**: 150

## üöÄ Features

- Fine-tuning YOLOv8 model on a TB X-ray dataset.
- Custom data augmentation tailored for medical images.
- Visualization scripts to display images with predicted bounding boxes.
- Evaluation metrics for model performance.
- Easy-to-use training and inference scripts.
